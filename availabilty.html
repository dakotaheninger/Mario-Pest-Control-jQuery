            <p>This page is sort of a work in progress, not because I don't know how to build it (that Bob guys is a
                great teacher), but because at the moment I can't seem to leave the castle grounds. As strange as it
                sounds, everytime I attempt to leave the castle grounds I am instantly teleported to the opposite side
                of the grounds. I haven't figured out yet if I just have to stay here until every pest is controlled, or
                if that Bob guy wrote me into an infinite loop. I have been a Plumber, Pest Control Technician, Web
                Developer, and don't forget Hero, but never a physicist. So if a physicist is reading this I would
                really appreciate some input. Anyway when I do figure out how to leave this area I will change this page
                to accept appointments!</p>
