                <p class="first-paragraph">Welcome to <span class="explain">SUPER MARIO PEST CONTROL!</span></p>
                <p>You are probably wondering to yourself "Why is Mario in the pest control business? He is clearly a plumber!" Well before we get to this amazing new pest control company let me explain!
                </p>
                <p>So there I am next to Peach, and having just defeated Bowser &#40;with style might I add&#41;, preparing for my &quot;Heroes Kiss&quot;, which I still have not received to this day, I was descended upon by a dark figure. When this mysterious figure rested before me his face was revealed. He said his name was Bob Ziroll and he was here to change my destiny. He removed a mysterious slim metal object from his nap-sack. He opened the object and an apple brighter than the sun at noon day did shine from the object. He began to move his fingers quickly as Peach and I eagerly awaited this new destiny. He finished typing and pressed a black rectangle with the word "return" on it.</p>
                <p>Instantly the man was gone. A portal opened beneath me and I began falling. The portal was pitch black. I couldn&#39;t see my own white glove two inches in front of my face. I reached out for anything to grab a hold of but there was nothing around. Shortly after I blacked out.</p>
                <p>When I awoke I was laying in front of a castle. I was instantly relieved, for it was the castle of my beloved Peach. I stood up and brushed myself off, ready for that &quot;Heroes Kiss&quot; I so desperately wanted. As I began to walk towards the castle I noticed an abundance of Goombas, Cheep-Cheeps, and Bob-ombs roaming around the castle. At that moment I realized I was carrying an object. I turned around and to my surprise there was a Star-Powered Hammer strapped to my back.</p>
                <p>At that moment Princess Peach burst from the balcony. In an extremely nagging tone, the one that all married men are familiar with, she yelled "Mario clean up these damn pests!!!!!". I looked down and noticed my blue overalls had changed to white. In large pixel letters, written right in the center of my overalls, were the words <span class="explain">&quot;PEST CONTROL TECHNICIAN.&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="last-paragraph">What Bob had described as a change of destiny turned out to be a curse of demonic proportions. I was destined to clear out pests at Peach Castle for the rest of eternity. Even worse, I was stuck in the &quot;Friend Zone&quot; with Peach, for who wants to date a Pest Control Technician. Anyway, long story short, I found that bastard Bob and forced him to teach me how to create this website so I can keep track of what Peach owes me. If I'm not getting any, then she's not getting any. Free pest control that is. </p>
